#This project analyzes one year of sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant.
#The goal is to explore revenue trends, customer purchasing behavior, and identify business improvement opportunities.

orders = pd.read_csv(r"/content/orders.csv")
order_details = pd.read_csv(r"/content/order_details.csv")
pizzas = pd.read_csv(r"/content/pizzas.csv")
pizza_types = pd.read_csv(r"/content/pizza_types.csv", encoding="latin1")

## Data Overview

In this section, we inspect the structure of each dataset to understand columns, data types, and relationships.

orders.head()


orders.info()

## Data Preparation

To perform analysis, the four datasets are merged into a single dataframe using common keys.

# Step 1: Merge order_details with pizzas
# This adds price, size, and pizza_type_id to each transaction

df = order_details.merge(pizzas, on="pizza_id", how="left")


# Step 2: Merge the result with pizza_types
# This adds pizza name, category, and ingredients

df = df.merge(pizza_types, on="pizza_type_id", how="left")


# Step 3: Merge with orders
# This adds date and time information for time-based analysis

df = df.merge(orders, on="order_id", how="left")

# Preview first few rows
df.head()

# Check structure and data types
df.info()

# Convert date column to datetime format
df["date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date"])

# Extract hour from time column
df["hour"] = pd.to_datetime(df["time"]).dt.hour

# Create revenue column (quantity × price)
df["revenue"] = df["quantity"] * df["price"]

# Extract day of week
df["day_of_week"] = df["date"].dt.day_name()

# Extract month name
df["month"] = df["date"].dt.month_name()

# Check final dataset structure
df.head()

# Confirm no major missing values
df.isnull().sum()

## 1. What is the total revenue generated?

# Calculate total revenue
total_revenue = df["revenue"].sum()
total_revenue

### Insight

total_orders = df["order_id"].nunique()
total_orders

### Insight
This represents the total number of customer transactions.

## 4. How many pizza types are offered?

num_pizza_types = df["pizza_type_id"].nunique()
num_pizza_types

## 5. What is the average price of pizzas?

average_price = df["price"].mean()
average_price

### Insight
The average price helps position the business within its pricing segment.

## 6. What are the peak hours of sales?

peak_hours = df.groupby("hour")["revenue"].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
peak_hours.head()

plt.figure()
df.groupby("hour")["revenue"].sum().sort_index().plot(kind="line")
plt.title("Revenue by Hour")
plt.xlabel("Hour of Day")
plt.ylabel("Revenue")
plt.show()

### Insight
Identifies the busiest hours of operation.

## 7. What day of the week generates the most sales?

sales_by_day = df.groupby("day_of_week")["revenue"].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
sales_by_day

plt.title("Total Sales by Day of Week")
plt.xlabel("Day of Week")
plt.ylabel("Revenue")
plt.show()

### Insight
Highlights weekly customer behavior patterns.

## 8. What are the top 5 bestselling pizzas?

top_5 = df.groupby("name")["quantity"].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)
top_5

### Insight
These pizzas drive the highest sales volume and should remain priority items.

## 9. What are the monthly sales trends?

sales_by_month = df.groupby("month")["revenue"].sum()

# Conclusion

The analysis reveals strong yearly performance with consistent revenue generation.
Sales peak during lunch hours and Fridays show the highest weekly revenue.
A few pizza types dominate total sales, while some underperform and may require strategic adjustments.
